Photo Gallery with CSS Flexbox
Project Overview
This project is a simple photo gallery built using HTML and CSS. The gallery utilizes CSS Flexbox to create a responsive and visually appealing layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. The images are sourced from the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, and the gallery is styled with Flexbox to ensure a neat, aligned presentation.

Features
Responsive Design: The gallery adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth and consistent layout on both desktop and mobile devices.
Flexbox Layout: The gallery uses Flexbox to align the images dynamically, allowing them to wrap and center properly, even when the screen size changes.
Clean and Simple UI: The design is minimalistic, with focus on content, using a dark-themed header and light background for the main gallery area.
Image Styling: The images have smooth corners, are uniformly sized, and are set to object-fit: cover to maintain their aspect ratio without distortion.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the webpage and displaying the content.
CSS3: To style the layout, including the use of Flexbox for responsive design.
FreeCodeCamp Image API: Images are sourced from the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.
